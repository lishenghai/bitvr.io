				<h4>Legal Notes</h4>
				<p> PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THIS WHITEPAPER – IN PARTICULAR, THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION SET OUT BELOW, INCLUDING THE FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT RISKS – BEFORE MAKING YOUR DECISION TO PURCHASE BITVR TOKENS. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT 360CENTRAL LIMITED (THE “COMPANY”), ITS BUSINESS PROJECTS, THE BITVR TOKENS OR OTHER RELATED CIRCUMSTANCES, PLEASE CONSULT A COMPETENT BUSINESS, LEGAL, TAX OR OTHER ADVISOR. IF YOU ARE IN DOUBT, OR IF ANY CIRCUMSTANCES REMAIN UNCLEAR TO YOU, YOU SHOULD REFRAIN FROM MAKING A PURCHASE.</p>

				<h4>No prospectus and no offer to purchase securities or financial instruments </h4>
				<p>The planned BitVR tokens have been designed as pure utility tokens and are not, therefore, intended to constitute securities or financial instruments according to their structure. Consequently, the present whitepaper does not constitute a prospectus or an offering document for securities or financial instruments and is not intended to constitute a prospectus or an offering document for securities or financial instruments in any jurisdiction. This whitepaper merely serves the purpose of describing the project but does not constitute an offer to purchase, or an invitation to submit an offer to purchase, the planned BitVR tokens. Insofar, this whitepaper also does not constitute investment advice recommending to purchase the planned BitVR tokens or to disinvest from other securities, financial instruments or other assets. Incidentally, there is no investment brokerage or investment advice of a security or financial instrument subject to authorization.</p>

				<h4>No official examination or approval </h4>
				<p>This whitepaper has not been examined or approved by any public authority, nor has it been submitted to any public authority for examination or approval. There are no express statutory requirements as to the contents of this whitepaper; the structure of this whitepaper and the information contained herein are based exclusively on the decisions of the Company’s management. </p>
				<p>Formation of a legal relationship only on the basis of separate agreements, documents and/or terms and conditions </p>
				<p>Any legal relations between a purchaser of the planned BitVR tokens and the Company will not be established through this whitepaper but through separate agreements, documents and/or terms and conditions governing the rights and obligations of the purchaser and of the Company. Insofar, the provisions of the aforesaid agreements, documents and/or terms and conditions will take precedence over the description given in this whitepaper in the event that the description in this whitepaper is unclear in any respect. </p>

				<h4>Excluded purchasers </h4>
				<p>The token sale (including any pre-sales) is not for purchasers having their domicile, their tax residence or their habitual residence in, or initiating the purchase of the tokens from or via, a country where the sale or purchase of cryptocurrencies is prohibited or is permitted only under certain conditions (e.g. an official licence), which has been classified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as a high-risk or other monitored jurisdiction with regard to money laundering or terrorism financing, or against which an embargo or sanctions have been imposed, in particular by the United States of America or the EU, (“excluded third parties”). Such countries particularly include Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Vanuatu and Yemen, but also the United State of America, the People’s Republic of China, Singapore and Cuba (“excluded countries”). This whitepaper may not be reproduced, in whole or in part, in whatever manner, or be passed on to third parties without this important information and the further information about risks. Furthermore, this whitepaper may not, in whole or in part, in whatever manner, be passed on to excluded third parties. </p>

				<h4>High risk of loss </h4>
				<p>The purchase of BitVR tokens involves significant risks. This is why a purchaser should not use a substantial portion of his, her or its property to purchase BitVR tokens and be able to bear the total loss of the money invested. Furthermore, purchasers should already have experience in purchasing and/or holding cryptocurrencies issued by young companies, be able to understand the economic and technical causal relations between the Company’s entrepreneurial activities and the BitVR tokens, and be able to assess how they will affect the value of the planned BitVR tokens. A lack of relevant experience on the part of a purchaser will nonetheless not give rise to increased obligations of the Company to provide information. </p>

				<h4>Loan-based financing not recommended </h4>
				<p>Purchasers are strongly advised against taking out a loan to finance the purchase of BitVR tokens. This is because the obligations to pay capital and interest will continue to exist even if the purchased BitVR tokens lose their value. In this case, the purchaser might even have to le for personal bankruptcy. </p>

				<h4>Whitepaper does not replace competent advice </h4>
				<p>The purchasers’ attention is drawn to the fact that this whitepaper gives only an overview of the Company’s planned in- vestment and business activities and of the planned BitVR tokens. This whitepaper cannot, however, replace business, legal, tax or other advice. Consequently, before making a purchase, each purchaser should examine the opportunities and risks involved on his, her or its own responsibility – where appropriate, assisted by external advisors. Purchasers are particularly advised to obtain advice on the legal, regulatory and tax consequences of a purchase. 
				The Company does not accept any liability for the personal economic objectives that purchasers wish to achieve by purchasing BitVR tokens. </p>

				<h4>Calculations, forecasts and forward-looking statements </h4>
				<p>All calculations and/or forecasts set out in this whitepaper are essentially based on the experiences or assessments made by the Company’s management. In this respect, this whitepaper additionally contains forward-looking statements – in particular, subjective objectives for the further development of the Company’s business, which involve uncertainties and risks, however. Such statements express the Company’s current assessments and expectations with regard to future events. These assessments and expectations may contain errors of perception or errors of judgment and may, therefore, turn out to be inaccurate. </p>
				<p>The calculations have been made with diligence and commercial prudence. In spite of this fact, there is a possibility that certain events or developments which have not been taken into consideration for the purposes of the calculations and/or forecasts will lead to significant deviations between the results actually achieved by the Company and such calculations and/or forecasts and, hence, possibly also to a loss of value of the planned BitVR tokens. </p>
				<p>Consequently, the Company cannot warrant that the developments and results described in this whitepaper will actually be achieved. The purchaser bears the risk of deviating developments and results. </p>

				<h4>Regulatory and other risks </h4>
				<p>The Company presumes that the issuance of the planned BitVR tokens by the Company, the purchase of the planned BitVR tokens and the use of the planned BitVR tokens (pure utility tokens) to pay for the Company’s products and services – in each case by non-excluded third parties – are not subject to separate regulation. However, the regulatory and quite generally the legal framework conditions for cryptocurrencies, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, smart contracts and their uses are, both nationally and internationally, far from being fully developed and from providing certainty. There is, therefore, a possibility that the issuance, purchase or administration of (including the trade in) cryptocurrencies or the use of cryptocurrencies to pay for products or services will be prohibited, in whole or in part, or will only be permitted subject to certain conditions, due to national or international official or legal measures or due to court rulings. This may have significant adverse effects on the Company’s business model (e.g. in the event that a public authority or a court orders that the issuance of the BitVR tokens be reversed or the Company discontinues its business) and on the bene t or value of the planned BitVR tokens and may even result in the Company becoming insolvent or in the planned BitVR tokens becoming entirely useless or worthless. </p>
				<p>In the same manner, there is a possibility that third-party companies providing ways to trade in cryptocurrencies, such as the planned BitVR tokens, will be prohibited from maintaining the trading venue operated by them in the absence of an appropriate official licence; if this happens, there may be no trading venues where to exchange the planned BitVR tokens for other cryptocurrencies or at currencies (i.e. legal currencies, such as the Euro). This, too, could result in the issued BitVR tokens becoming useless or worthless to their purchasers. </p>

				<h4>Utility tokens do not grant any property rights or administrative rights in the Company </h4>
				<p>The planned BitVR tokens are intended to be structured as pure utility tokens with which to pay for the Company’s pro- ducts and services. The planned BitVR tokens will not grant any property rights or administrative rights in the Company, i.e. they will not grant any share in the Company’s profits or losses or in an increase or decrease in the value of the Company’s assets or any rights to vote when resolutions are made at the Company, rights to attend shareholder meetings of the Company or other shareholder rights. As pure utility tokens, the BitVR tokens are not suitable as an investment in the development of the Company’s business. </p>

				<h4>No repayment </h4>
				<p>As the BitVR tokens will be pure utility tokens, the purchase prices paid for the issued BitVR tokens will not be paid back in exchange for the return of the issued BitVR tokens. Purchasers of the planned BitVR tokens must, therefore, take into consideration that the money used by them to purchase BitVR tokens will be bound within the tokens and can, at best, be exchanged again for at currencies via third-party trading systems, to the extent that such systems are available. To the extent that a third party who is willing to exchange at currencies for the purchased BitVR tokens cannot be found, there is a risk that the purchased BitVR tokens will be useless or worthless to the purchaser. </p>

				<h4>Tradability and fluctuations in the value of the BitVR tokens </h4>
				<p>A promise that the planned BitVR tokens will be tradable cannot be given. Even though the Company seeks to have the planned BitVR tokens listed for trading on one or more trading systems, there is a possibility that the Company will not succeed in finding one or more appropriate trading systems that are willing and able to list the planned BitVR tokens for trading. Even if the Company succeeds in having the planned BitVR tokens listed for trading at one or more trading venues, there is a possibility that there will be no trade for lack of interested purchasers or sellers. Even if and to the extent that the Company succeeds in having the planned BitVR tokens listed for trading on one or more trading systems, purchasers should be prepared for very significant fluctuations, including short-term fluctuations, in the determined price and, hence, in the value of the purchased BitVR tokens. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the prices or values of the planned BitVR tokens develop differently on different trading systems. How the planned BitVR tokens perform on trading systems may be greatly influenced by the performance of other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ether, even if the Company’s operational business does not provide any reason or basis for such changes in performance (if any). </p>
				<p>The Company does not guarantee that the trading systems where the planned BitVR tokens will be listed for trading (if any) will determine the prices in a transparent manner or will be able to meet the legal or official requirements (if any). </p>
				<p>A purchaser should further take into consideration that the trade in purchased BitVR tokens will probably involve costs, which will have to be borne additionally by the purchaser and will have a further adverse effect on the value of the BitVR tokens purchased and/or traded.</p> 

				<h4>Dependence on computer infrastructure </h4>
				<p>Both the Company’s operational business model and the functionality of the planned BitVR tokens depend to a large extent on the existence and permanent availability of a well-functioning computer infrastructure. This particularly applies to the Company, to purchasers of the planned BitVR tokens, and to customers of the Company. Any problems with or burden on a well-functioning computer infrastructure (including Internet with appropriate capacities) would place a burden on the establishment and further development of the operational business but also on the possibility to use the planned BitVR tokens and might even render the latter entirely useless or worthless. If the required infrastructure is not sufficiently functional, this may significantly reduce the speed with which transactions involving the planned BitVR tokens are handled and, hence, have a significant and lasting adverse effect on the usability or value of the planned BitVR tokens.</p> 

				<h4>Operational risks encountered by the Company </h4>
				<p>Like any other company, in particular, any other young company, the Company is subject to operational risks. The development of the planned products and services, for example, may be significantly delayed or turn out to be impossible, in whole or in part. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the Company’s planned products or services will not be accepted on the market. In addition, there is a possibility that the Company will be unable to obtain and maintain sufficient licences that are required for its operational business or that the licences granted are challenged by third parties, which can normally result in a large amount of costs being incurred in defending claims and/or enforcing rights. Moreover, competitors or the development of new products and technologies or the regulation of the Company’s operational business, whether at national or international level, may place a significant burden on the Company’s operational business. Operational risks, in particular those listed above, may lead to the Company’s insolvency. At the same time, operational risks may have a significant and lasting adverse effect on the planned BitVR tokens and even render them entirely useless or worthless. </p>

				<h4>Insufficient funding of the Company </h4>
				<p>As a young company, the Company depends on generating sufficient funds to set up and further develop its business (including maintaining an infrastructure for using the planned BitVR tokens). The plan is to use the proceeds from the issuance of the planned BitVR tokens for this purpose, for a start. If the Company does not succeed in generating sufficient funds, e.g. if the BitVR token ICO fails, there is a risk that the Company will be unable to set up and further develop its business necessary, or even file for insolvency. Such a development might have a significant and lasting adverse effect on the usability or value of the planned BitVR tokens and might even render them entirely useless or worthless.</p> 

				<h4>Technical risks </h4>
				<p>The planned BitVR tokens, by their very nature, are technology-based. Like with all other technology-based products or services, their usability and their value are subject to a large number of technical risks that cannot be eliminated by the Company. This particularly includes system errors, code failures, programming errors, hardware failures, loss and/or theft of data, hacks and/or attacks by hackers or technology-based reductions in the speed with which transactions can be handled. Technical risks may have significant and lasting adverse Effects on the usability or value of the BitVR tokens and might even render them entirely useless or worthless. </p>

				<h4>Risks involved in the personal administration of tokens </h4>
				<p>Like any other cryptocurrency, the planned BitVR tokens are subject to risks arising from personal administration. The risks arising from personal administration are, in particular, failure or theft of the hardware used to store the purchased BitVR tokens or loss of access codes, user names, passwords or private keys for accessing the infrastructure used to store the purchased BitVR tokens (e.g. wallets) such that the purchased BitVR tokens can no longer be disposed of and are, hence, lost for the purchaser. There is additionally a risk that transactions which have been initiated incorrectly cannot be reversed because of how the blockchain technology works and that the transferred BitVR tokens are, hence, irretrievably lost. Furthermore, it needs to be taken into consideration that using inherited BitVR tokens is, de facto, impossible because of the technology used for the planned BitVR tokens and also because there is no or only an insufficiently developed legal framework. </p>

				<h4>Tax risks </h4>
				<p>Not only are there no unambiguous and clear legal framework conditions in connection with cryptocurrencies, the national and international tax classification of transactions involving cryptocurrencies also remains to be finally clarified, both for the Company and for purchasers of cryptocurrencies. There is, therefore, a possibility that transactions involving cryptocurrencies will, both on the part of the Company and on the part of purchasers, give rise to tax burdens which place a burden on the Company’s operational business or which reduce the usability or value of the purchased BitVR tokens or even render the latter entirely useless or worthless. </p>

				<h4>Disclosure of personal data on the basis of official measures </h4>
				<p>Purchasers must have their identity verified in accordance with the anti-money laundering rules and the rules to combat terrorism financing and tax evasion and disclose personal data in relation to them to the Company before purchasing the planned BitVR tokens. The purchasers of the planned BitVR tokens should be prepared that the Company may be required to disclose the collected personal data to competent authorities on the basis of national or international official or legal measures. </p>

				<h4>Interaction of risks and cumulative risks </h4>
				<p>Each of the described risks alone may have significant and lasting adverse effects on the usability and value of the planned BitVR tokens. There is a possibility that several risks will materialise simultaneously, trigger each other, or reinforce each other and that this will enhance the significant and lasting adverse effects. Both the materialisation of individual risks and the materialisation of cumulative risks may render the planned BitVR tokens entirely useless or worthless.</p>
